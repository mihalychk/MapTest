# MapTest

## Task

Build an app that, based on a geolocation, tells the user in which country the location lies. The app has to work without Internet access. It has to show a map of the world, with some way of specifying a location. It has to show the country name of the country at that location. Try to optimize the app for speed (users do not like waiting) and keep an eye on memory usage (users do not like crashing apps). Your code should contain comments to clarify anything that you think needs clarification.
